The decision of deploying trials for 5G network in India has been in discussing for a long while. In late December, 2019 Indian govt. had allowed all network operators to participate in the 5G trials in India, including Huawei, which being Chinese, was already excluded by US, Australia, New Zealand, and some others from deploying 5G trial.

While the mobile phones companies that would be allotted 5G spectrum believed to work with the Chinese vendors for 5G trials as well as for future developments, the Indian govt. cautioned that the clearance for 5G deployments by the Chinese vendors was only for the test phase.

Vodafone Idea had applied to partner with Ericsson and Huawei for 5G trials, while Bharti Airtel had sought permission to conduct trials with Nokia, Huawei and Ericsson. Rival Reliance Jio Infocomm had applied for a pilot initiative with Samsung, BSNL had applied with ZTE and Nokia.

However in late June, 2020, with the recent border tension with China escalating, clouds of uncertainty hang once again over 5G trials and the fate of Chinese vendors like Huawei and ZTE – whether they would be allowed to participate or not. The government, which had allowed telecom operators to file applications along with the Chinese vendors in January, has now decided that a ministry of home affairs-led committee will take a final call in the matter.

There may have been some diplomatic breakthrough in the border stand-off with China but the same cannot be said about the impending 5G trials for which all operators are partnering with one of the two Chinese vendors — Huawei and ZTE. Although the trials take place with very limited spectrum and a few base stations and are aimed at fixing the glitches, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) is understood to have hardened its stance on two counts — remote access and data storage. The agency is reportedly against data going outside the country during the trials and it also does not want remote access to be granted to the Chinese vendors.

For such reasons, it is still a matter of ongoing debate as to whether Chinese vendors should be allowed for 5G trials when the risk of loss of data-privacy could be at stake.
