COVID-19 was like a pelted stone in a still pond. It is that hurricane which made the entire world still. Imagine, the whole world stopped and everyone was inside waiting for the world to return to it’s normalcy. It was that devastating wave that swapped away a large portion of the world’s population. It was just like blinking your eyes and numbers increased. The invisible DEATH was finishing our civilization. Was waiting enough? Miracles do happen but patience won’t create it. SCIENCE is itself a miracle , it is the real magic. The COVID-19(SARS-coV-2) is that complex question the solution of which seemed almost impossible. The virus was new. Scientists were just trying to understand it when the INVISIBLE infected a huge number of people. Science is that power which creates even the expectation a reality. The ears of billions of people were waiting to hear, “VACCINE IS OUT. WE ARE READY TO FIGHT NOW”.The scientists across the world were working day and night for a ray of hope and there came a light,a light to vanish the invisible.Several countries like UK, USA, RUSSIA etc. started testing their vaccines and following that our Indian laboratories were also finding a finest solution to the virus.

**Pune-based Serum Institute of India** announced that it would apply for clinical trials of certain strains from Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in April 2020. As per company president Adar Poonawalla, a vaccine for COVID-19 will be delivered within a year. **Zydus cadilaand** Hyderabad based **Bharat Biotechin** collaboration with US based FluGen were also trying to develop a vaccine. The former was replicating viral vector vaccine and hence developing a DNA plasmid vaccine. By the month of May,there were about 30 institutes in india preparing for the COVID-19 vaccine and many were already in their pre-clinical tests. ICMR was preparing to launch **BBV152 COVID** vaccine or **Covaxin**, India's first COVID-19 vaccine on 15 August following its ongoing human trials in July.But, later it was decided to launch the vaccine in the first half of 2021 to cut “red tape”.  was showing a positive result on animals in building immunity against COVID-19. Following that Zydus cadila also began the human trials of it’s vaccine *ZyCoV-D*.In early August, SII's got approval from DCGI for trial phases II & III. SII has also joined **GAVI** in a partnership with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to produce 100 million doses of vaccine for developing countries

On 1 January 2021,the Drug Controller General of India, approved the emergency or conditional use of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine AZD1222 (marketed as Covishield).Covishield is developed by the University of Oxford and its spin-out company, Vaccitech. It’s a viral vector vaccine based on replication-deficient Adenovirus that causes cold in Chimpanzees. But, on the very next day the indigenous vaccine came into the market named COVAXIN developed by BHARAT BIOTECH in association with Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) and National Institute of Virology. The drug controller general of India though approved the vaccine but there was a restriction as the 3 phase trial was not yet over. However, on 3rd March 2021, BIOTECH declared the use of COVAXIN was safe and it had 81% efficiency against the virus. Thus, many states promoted the use of COVISHEILD in the vaccination programme and kept COVAXIN as the buffer stock. The vaccination drive was carried out in phases. In the veryfirst phase, all the health workers and the front line workers irrespective of their ages were vaccinated. In the second phase, all above the age of 60 years and people between the age group 45-60 years having certain comorbidity were vaccinated. To ease the process of registration COWIN 2.0 was also launched by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Inthe third phase, the people of age group 45 years and above are being vaccinated.

In January 2021 Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres said that India's vaccine-production capacity is the best asset the world has. According to health officials, India has administered 9,43,34,262 (94 million) vaccine doses across the country as of 8 April 2021. On 8th April 2021, our honourable Prime Minister announced “Teeka Utsav” from 11th-14th April when maximum people of age above 45 years will be vaccinated across the countriesat various health care centres, apartment complex, housing colonies, conventional halls, work places and more. If there is ailment, there will surely be a cure. The Government of India on 19 April 2021 announced phase 4 of the vaccination drive, all persons above 18 years of age would be eligible to get covid-19 vaccine from 1 May 2021.

The whole world including our country is struggling to get the most effective solution. The health workers, the scientists and all the people who are involved in the vaccination drive have shown the LIGHT TO LIVE for all the Indians. The struggle is not yet finished,with the arrival of the second wave of Covid-19, it has become a necessity to get vaccinated and make our immunity strong. We should also acknowledge and feel proud for the COVAXIN , OUR VERY OWN, INDIAN VACCINE. On 20 April 2021, BHARAT BIOTECH scaled up its manufacturing capacities of COVAXINto 700 million doses per annum.This has made the company’s production capacities one of the largest for inactivated viral vaccines globally. However, with an increase in number of COVID-19 infected people in the country, an expert panel also approved SPUTNIK-V, the RUSSIAN DEVELOPMENT for emergency use in India on 12 April 2021. It completed it’s phase -iii clinical trial in India in September 2020 and the result was 91.6% efficiency. LET’S GET VACCINATED AND BREAK THE CHAIN OF SPREAD. WITH THE PROPER PRACTICE OF SOCIAL DISTANCING,FREQUENT SANITIZATION AND WEARING A MASK CAN SAVE YOU AND MANY AROUND YOU. STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY.
