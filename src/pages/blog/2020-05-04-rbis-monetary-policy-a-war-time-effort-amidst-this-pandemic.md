With more than 30 lakh people getting infected worldwide and over 2 lakhs dead the COVID-19 pandemic shows no signs of abating. As vaccine is yet to be found lockdown is the only way to slow it's spread. However the lockdown has its own disadvantages as it is  forcing the global economy to plunge into the worst recession this world has ever seen since the Great Depression of 1930's.Every country is falling susceptible to it including the superpower USA and India is no exception to it. According to a study by Moody, the combined economy of the G-20 countries which account for around 80% of the world economy, will contract by 0.5% followed by a 3.2% growth in 2021.Moody also cut India's 2020 growth forecast from 5.3% to 2.5% which will be followed by a 5.8% growth next year.

The Indian economy along with the global economy is now facing an extraordinary and unprecedented situation and it will take wartime  effort to overcome this pandemic. Thus to help the Indian economy revive the RBI is taking calibrated and periodic steps based on the feedback from the ground. Since the past 2 months RBI announced some changes in its monetary policy in 2 phases in the month of March and April.

# Phase-1

* In the month of March the Monetary Policy Committee of RBI  reduced  it's repo rate by 75bps from an earlier of 5.15% to  4.4%. This ensures that  banks decreases their interest rate on loan and give loans to various sectors which will help to kick-start the economy.But it is a known fact that bank will be concerned about the repayment capacity of the borrower's during this time and will be hesitant to give loans. Thus generally the bank in this type of situations tend to park fund with RBI and get interest. This type of banking is known as lazy banking and to counter this RBI announced that it will reduce its Reverse repo rate from 4.9% to 4.0%.Both these measures infuse liquidity into the economy which is the need of the hour.
* RBI also decreased it's Cash reserve ratio(CRR) from 4% to 3% which frees up around Rs 1.37 lakh crore in liquidity.
* RBI also decreased it's Marginal standing facility(MSF) from 5.4% to 4.65%.This decrease in interest by RBI provides more funds to bank which is about Rs 1.37 lakh crore.
* RBI also decided to give a 3 month moratorium on payment of EMIs for a period of 3 months starting from 1st March-31st May.During this period customers don't need to pay EMI on their loan.This is applied for all types of loans and it extends to all banks and NBFC's and the final decision to provide such relief is in the hands of banks. 
* RBI also decided to conduct Long term Repo operations which increases around Rs 1 lakh crore in liquidity. Under this operation RBI auctioned it's Long term repurchasement contract to provide liquidity to bank but it mandated the banks to invest it in Investment Great Bonds,Commercial Papers and Non convertible debentures of NBFC's.

# Phase-2

In the month of April, to facilitate more infusion of liquidity, RBI introduced a package of Rs 1 lakh crore under which Rs 50,000 Cr will be for the refinancing agencies like NABARD, NHB, SIDBI and another Rs 50,000 crore to the NBFC's since the NBFC'S are facing a tough time as they have to continue onto the repayment of their loan since commercial bank didn't give any moratorium to NBFC for its loan and at the same time NBFC's are giving loan moratorium to its customers.Thus it results in a significant amount of outgo of cash and places the NBFC's under a lot of stress. Thus to help them RBI came up with this package.

To help the state with its expenditure on health infrastructure, effective quarantine measures RBI increased its limit under The Way and Means Advance.Thus the states can now avail upto a short term funds to 60% of its existing limit.

Thus through this measures RBI infused the much required oxygen in the economy.Though the effects of inflation may be seen over the horizon in near future but RBI governor,Mr Shaktikanta Das said that this measures won't have any significant effect in the inflation situation for the time being as currently the inflation trend is on decline and this declining trend paves away  an opportunistic path for India to infuse liquidity in the system which will help in kick starting the economy.
